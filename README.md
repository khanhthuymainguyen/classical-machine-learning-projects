# machine-learning-projects
A collection of classical machine learning projects from scikitlearn library and Python 

## 1st project: Iris dataset
Most of the code is from this site: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ 

I only tweak a little by importing missing libraries from Scikit
